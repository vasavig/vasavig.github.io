Feature matching
Results on various images

notre dame: 0.04 0.005 0.5
mt rushmore: 0.04 0.005 0.30 - increasing alpha improved from 77 to 91%
epicogal gaudi - much difference in intensity - improving gaussian sigma increased blur and therefore techniques like PCA-SIFT work better with blurred images, num of matched points, viewing angle; accuracy improved with increasing the alpha param in harris corner 3 to 6%
